This study explores the intricate relationships between various lifestyle factors and sleep health among 374 individuals. Our dataset encompasses a diverse range of attributes including demographic details (gender, age, occupation), lifestyle habits (physical activity level, daily steps), health indicators (BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate), and sleep parameters (sleep duration, quality of sleep, presence of sleep disorders).


## Project Objective
-  Analyze Sleep Duration and Quality:
  1.  Investigate the correlation between the Maximum sleep duration in relation to the quality of sleep reported by individuals.
  2.  Determine optimal sleep durations that contribute to higher sleep quality.
-  Examine Physical Activity's Impact on Sleep:
  1.  Explore how different levels of physical activity correlate with the quality of sleep.
  2.  Identify physical activity patterns that promote better sleep quality.
-  Assess the Influence of Stress Levels on Sleep:

  2.  Identify stress management strategies that could improve sleep health.
-  Investigate the Role of BMI in Sleep Disorders:
  1.  Examine the prevalence of sleep disorders across different BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
  2.  Understand how BMI influences sleep health and the incidence of sleep disorders.


## Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing datasets for analysis. The following are the Preprocess that was used in analyzing the Raw data given to us

  1.  Reading the dataset and assigning appropriate column names.
  2.  Removing Duplicates: We found a lot of  duplicated values in the data and we got them cleaned using  the find and replace command.
  3.  Using the TRIM Function: we made use of the TRIM function to remove leading and trailing spaces from a text string in the data
  4.   Classifying the AGE Using the IF function: We classed the Age in the data into using the IF function to class them into the Youth or Adult
